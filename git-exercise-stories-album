Waiting For Love
Avicii


[Verse 1]
>>>>>
And every night has its day, so magical
And if there's love in this life, there's no obstacle
That can't be defeated
For every tyrant a tear for the vulnerable
In every lost soul the bones of a miracle
>>>>
>>>>


[Chorus]
Monday >>>>
Tuesday >>>>
Wednesday >>>>
Thursday waiting for love, >>>>
>>>> it's Friday
>>>> on Saturday
>>>> on Sunday
I'll be waiting for love
>>>> to come around


[Verse 2]
>>>>
How did I get so blind and so cynical?
If there's love in this life we're unstoppable
>>>>


[Chorus]
Monday left me broken
>>>>
Wednesday my empty arms were open
Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love
>>>>
>>>>
Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
>>>>
>>>>
>>>>
